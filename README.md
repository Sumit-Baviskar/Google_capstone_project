# :paperclip: **Tools :**

-  **SQL (Data Exploration, Data Manipualtion)**

-  **EXCEL (Data Visualization)**


# :paperclip: Business Questions:


**1) Finding numbers of users in Bella beat using different datasets ?**


**2) To find the relationship calories and total steps ?**


**3) To find and analyze relation between total step and sedentary minutes ?**


**4) Examine the active and sedentary minutes inn daliy part of life of users ?**


**5) Calculation of the most active week day on average ?**


**6) Find the realtion between average sleep on weekdays?**



# :paperclip: **Dataset Information :**

In this phase, I viewed all **18 files and decided to use 6 of the 18 files from datasets** that are available to help with my analysis. The datasets chosen will be the following:

 - **dailyActivity_merged.csv**

 - **dailyCalories_merged.csv**

 - **dailyIntensities_merged.csv**

 - **dailySteps_merged.csv**

 - **weightLogInfo_merged.csv**

I applied a dual approach, leveraging both Excel and SQL, to perform comprehensive data analysis. Each table, seamlessly imported from the original dataset, bore nomenclature consistent with its counterpart in the source dataset. In the cleaning phase, I adeptly employed both Excel and SQL to refine data types, meticulously configuring datetime fields to exclusively house date information or be tailored specifically to capture time (or activity hours).


# :paperclip: **Data Manipualtion and Analysis :** 


###  **1) Finding numbers of users in Bella beat using different datasets ?**


I have use a distinct command with count to known if there are unique values are there in each column.


:paperclip: **CODE**


    use fitband;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM daily_activity;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM daily_calories;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM daily_intensities;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM daily_steps;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM sleep_day;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM weight_log;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM heart_rate;

The analysis highlights a noticeable trend: daily activity, daily calories, daily intensities, and daily steps gain more user attention, whereas daily steps, sleep data, and weight log information have fewer users engaged.

### :key: Recommendation:
In response to user preferences, it is recommended to focus product efforts on refining and expanding features related to daily activities, calorie tracking, intensity monitoring, and step counts. Strengthening these aspects could lead to increased sales and heightened user satisfaction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### **2) To find the relationship calories and total steps ?**

Cleaning the data for with the value zero and only analysis the values with non-zero summation of all three columns activity level and calories burnt


:paperclip: **CODE** 


    Select *

    from daily_activity

    Where VeryActiveDistance+ModeratelyActiveDistance+LightActiveDistance != 0 

    And VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes != 0

    Order BY TotalSteps Desc;

ðŸ”‘ **Recommendation :**

To engage with users whose calorie intake is higher, suggestions for active and calorie-burning activities can be made. Additionally, providing users with information on adjusting their calorie intake according to their fitness goals can contribute to their overall health and well-being

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### **3) To find and analyze relation between total step and sedentary minutes ?**

:paperclip: **CODE**


    SELECT Id, ActivityDate,Calories, TotalSteps,

    TotalDistance, 
 
    (VeryActiveDistance+ModeratelyActiveDistance+LightActiveDistance) AS Total_Active_Distance,
 
    SedentaryActiveDistance, 
 
    (VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes) AS Total_Active_Minutes,
 
    SedentaryMinutes
 
    FROM daily_activity

    ORDER BY  Total_Active_Distance DESC;

To derive insights, we aggregated data on the least active and less sedentary minutes, combining them with sedentary minutes for a direct comparison with total steps. Our analysis reveals a negative relationship: an increase in sedentary minutes corresponds to a decrease in total steps (active minutes). This correlation is visually represented by a downward-trending line, underscoring the consistent decline in total steps as sedentary minutes rise.
