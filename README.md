# :chart_with_upwards_trend: Google_Capstone_Project :chart_with_upwards_trend:
This is capstone project for analaysis the data from company to analyze and conclude the result in order to data driven decision. 
Bellabeat data analysis case study . In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. In this secanrio I am  working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. 

# :paperclip: Tools
--> **SQL**(Data Exploration,Data Manipualtion)


--> **EXCEL**(Data Visualization)


# :paperclip: Business Questions:

1) Finding numbers of users in Bella beat using different datasets ?
2) To find the relationship calories and total steps ?
3) To find and analyze relation between total step and sedentary minutes ?
4) Examine the active and sedentary minutes inn daliy part of life of users ?
5) Calculation of the most active week day on average ?
6) Find the realtion between average sleep on weekdays?

# :paperclip: Dataset Information:-
In this phase, I viewed all **18 files and decided to use 6 of the 18 files from datasets** that are available to help with my analysis. The datasets chosen will be the following:

â€¢ dailyActivity_merged.csv

â€¢ dailyCalories_merged.csv

â€¢ dailyIntensities_merged.csv 

â€¢ dailySteps_merged.csv

â€¢ weightLogInfo_merged.csv

I applied a dual approach, leveraging both Excel and SQL, to perform comprehensive data analysis. Each table, seamlessly imported from the original dataset, bore nomenclature consistent with its counterpart in the source dataset. In the cleaning phase, I adeptly employed both Excel and SQL to refine data types, meticulously configuring datetime fields to exclusively house date information or be tailored specifically to capture time (or activity hours).


# :paperclip: SQL Code(Data Manipualtion and Analysis)


:paperclip:  Count Number Of Unquie User In FitBand According To Following Activities--


I have use a distinct command with count to known if there are unique values are there in each column.


:paperclip:CODE**


    use fitband;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM daily_activity;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM daily_calories;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM daily_intensities;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM daily_steps;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM sleep_day;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM weight_log;

    SELECT Count(distinct ID)  FROM heart_rate;

The analysis highlights a noticeable trend: daily activity, daily calories, daily intensities, and daily steps gain more user attention, whereas daily steps, sleep data, and weight log information have fewer users engaged.

# :key: Recommendation:
In response to user preferences, it is recommended to focus product efforts on refining and expanding features related to daily activities, calorie tracking, intensity monitoring, and step counts. Strengthening these aspects could lead to increased sales and heightened user satisfaction.

**# For finding activity level and calories burnt and also clean the data**--
Cleaning the data for with the value zero and only analysis the values with non-zero summation of all three columns activity level and calories burnt


**:paperclip:CODE** 


    Select *

    from daily_activity

    Where VeryActiveDistance+ModeratelyActiveDistance+LightActiveDistance != 0 

    And VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes != 0

In the provided SQL code, data for the least active members are cleaned by removing entries of individuals with columns such as Very Active Distance, Moderately Active Distance, Light Active Distance, Very Active Minutes, Fairly Active Minutes, and Lightly Active Minutes having values of zero.Taking the dataset into excel for further data visualization and forming scatter chart from the dataset.

**Recommendation:**
To engage with users whose calorie intake is higher, suggestions for active and calorie-burning activities can be made. Additionally, providing users with information on adjusting their calorie intake according to their fitness goals can contribute to their overall health and well-being

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**# For finding activity level and calories burnt---**

**:paperclip:CODE**


    SELECT Id, ActivityDate,Calories, TotalSteps,

    TotalDistance, 
 
    (VeryActiveDistance+ModeratelyActiveDistance+LightActiveDistance) AS Total_Active_Distance,
 
    SedentaryActiveDistance, 
 
    (VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes) AS Total_Active_Minutes,
 
    SedentaryMinutes

    ORDER BY  Total_Active_Distance DESC;

To derive insights, we aggregated data on the least active and less sedentary minutes, combining them with sedentary minutes for a direct comparison with total steps. Our analysis reveals a negative relationship: an increase in sedentary minutes corresponds to a decrease in total steps (active minutes). This correlation is visually represented by a downward-trending line, underscoring the consistent decline in total steps as sedentary minutes rise.

**Recommendation:**

User should be notified for Taking Regular Breaks while siting for that send notification and reminders, recommendation for active hobbies ,suggest walking ,reduce screen time and use practice Desk Exercises and standing desk.

As seen here, the majority of users using the Bellabeat product spend more time in sedentary minutes than in the combined durations of lightly active, fairly active, and very active minutes. This insight serves as a significant eye- opener, revealing that a substantial portion of the user base tends to have more inactive time than active time, which may impact their overall health.

     In MySQL, the SQL_SAFE_UPDATES mode can be disabled by setting it back to 1.

	 It's important to note that setting SQL_SAFE_UPDATES to 0.can potentially lead to unintended updates and deletions, so use it       with caution

This is imported in Excel and line chart is obtain for observation.
After examining the data, a noticeable pattern emerges regarding the average total steps, total distance, and calories. The line chart indicates that Saturday and Tuesday, with Monday in close succession, are the days when people are most active. Conversely, Sunday and Monday appears to be the least favored day for exercise or physical activity.

# ðŸ”‘ Recommendation:**
To boost activity on less active days, consider increasing notifications to motivate users. Furthermore, on days with higher activity levels, introducing notifications related to nutritious eating habits and reminders for adequate hydration could be valuable additional features.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**# To reverse the setting, you can use the following command:**

**:paperclip: CODE**
  
    SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**# updating the string to date**

we are taking the date from string formating the date from sleep_day table

**:paperclip:CODE**

**:paperclip:CODE**

     Alter Table sleep_day

     ADD day_of_week varchar(20);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**# to extract the day of the week**

To extract the day name of the date from sleepday from the sleep_day table

**:paperclip: CODE**

    UPDATE sleep_day
   
    SET Day_of_Week = dayname(SleepDay);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**:paperclip:extracting the data**

We are extracting week of the day or dayname and rounding of the average of Total Minutes Asleep from table and groupin by day.

**:paperclip:CODE**

    Select day_of_week,round(avg(TotalMinutesAsleep), 0) AS Avg_Sleep
   
    FROM sleep_day

**ðŸ”‘ Recommendation:**

After analyzing the data, it's evident that Sunday, Thursday, and Monday emerge as the least active days of the week. This trend translates to increased sedentary time and decreased active time, potentially hindering individuals from reaching their set fitness goals in a timely manner. Addressing strategies to boost activity on these specific days may contribute significantly to overall goal achievement.
